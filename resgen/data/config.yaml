# Which recipe and resume is the default? Recipe settings there override
# anything in this file. (They can also override the default resume for that
# recipe.) Recipe files are named <name>_recipe.yaml, while resume files are
# named <name>_resume.yaml.
default_inputs:
  recipe: default
  resume: default

# Which formats to generate. Currently supports html and pdf.
output_type:
  - html
  - pdf

# Tags and priority: These two settings control which resume items appear in the 
# output. Tags are useful for categorizing items, while priority can be used to
# produce different resume lengths for different purposes. Both options work by
# excluding items which don't match. Therefore, only items which match BOTH
# settings will be included in the output.
#
# Which tags to include. Only items having at least one of the tags in this list
# will be included. If this list is empty, all tags will be included.
tags:
  - short
  - long

# Which priority do we want? Items with a priority less than or equal to this
# value will be included. Set to `null` to include all items.
priority: 5

# The following sections contain settings specific to their output format.

# Options for HTML output
html:

  # If false, the default, will generate only the HTML necessary for the resume.
  # Output will be suitable for inserting into a website template. If false,
  # You must provide `prelude` and `postlude`, which will be attached to the
  # beginning and end og the HTML output to produce a complete HTML document.
  full_document: false

  # Headings in the output will use this level. E.g.: heading_level: 1 means
  # that top-level headings will produce H1 tags. Setting the level to 2 (the
  # default) means that top-level headings will procude H2 tags. And so on.
  heading_level: 2

  # If true, any resume item with an ID or a name will have its corresponding
  # HTML id specified in the output.
  set_ids: true

  # See the documentation for "full_document," above.
