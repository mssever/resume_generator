# Resume Generator

This program generates resumes. Given a master resume source, it can generate 
tailored resumes. That way, you can maintain only one resume and generate 
whichever versions you need. This greatly simplifies the resume creating 
process.

# Dependencies

- Python 3.6 or greater
- [ruamel YAML](https://yaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): `pip install ruamel.yaml`
